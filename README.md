VillagerShops
=====

Description:
-----

This plugin allows you to set up villagers or other mobs as shops.
They will sell items as admin shop (this means infinite stock), player shops planned.
The shop will be displayed as two row inventory you can modify with chat commands as admin.
Buy items from the top row and sell them at the bottom row.
You can also name the shop mobs and set the variant (Villager profession).

Beta:
-----
Purpose of the BETA is to figure out if the entity duplication problem the Bukkit-version always had is now fixed. Shops do not work yet because the Invetory API is not implemented afaik.
