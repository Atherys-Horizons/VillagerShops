VillagerShops
=====

Description:
-----

This plugin allows you to set up villagers or other mobs as shops.
They will sell items as admin shop (this means infinite stock), player shops planned.
The shop will be displayed as two (or more) row inventory you can modify with chat commands as admin.
Buy items from the top row and sell them at the bottom row.
You can also name the shop mobs and set the variant (Villager profession).

Beta:
-----
The entity duplication problem as in the Bukkit-version is now fixed.
So far shops should work and be pretty stable. (Needs testing)
